TIL stands for Today I Learned, and a TIL Blog is where you can make share new or interesting stuff that you have learned recently.

The main reasons why I have started one and you might want to start one too are:

1. The best way to learn is to teach, writing about what you have learned recently will cement it in your mind better.
2. Knowledge sharing, helps other people and makes you feel good inside.
3. Continuous Learning, something that we all need, and having this type of blog incentivizes it more.
4. Improve writing skills, because we improve by practicing.
5. Document self-growth, that way you have something to look back on with pride and possibly to share with potential employers.
6. Meeting new people, if you keep at it, eventually someone will notice.

Low barrier of entry, big output and good outcomes, a TIL Blog looks like a good time investment to me. 

If you decide to start a TIL Blog, share it with me!
