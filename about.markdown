I'm a Python Developer but I also have worked as a DevOps Engineer, mostly writing Terraform for the AWS Cloud. 

I'm a big fan of Open Source, Linux, Python and Godot. 

Outside of work I like playing guitar and making music.

Right now I'm working at [Ikigai Digital](https://ikigaidigital.io/), an IT services company that provides consulting, cloud computing, database, and ecosystem integration. We build digital banks.

This blog uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the theme is [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).
